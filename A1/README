This directory contains a scanner to collect all relevant tags for a SGML language.

To build the scanner, type "make" in the current directory. To test the code
type "java Scanner < [filename]" and the relavant information will be displayed.

To rebuild the scanner, type "make clean" and type "make" again.

NOTE: This code uses the SampleScanner code that was provided. 

Future Improvements: 
- Add in more important tags to ensure that all relevant information is collected.
- Create a more indepth hierarchy about when certain tags are important.

Test Plan:
- Tested all valid tag combinations
- Tested all relevant tags and nesting inside irrelevant tags
- Tested all left over tags are printed in stderr
- Tested mismatched tags are printed in stderr
- Tested all word combinations
- Tested all numbers including +, - and  .
- Tested all hyphenated posibilities
- Tested all apostrophized word posibilities
- Tested blank files
- Tested P in irrelevant and relevant tags
- Tested attributes and spaces in open tags
- Tested spaces in closed tags
